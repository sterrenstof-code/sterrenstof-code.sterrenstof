Finally this contrast is overcome and returned back into its former simplicity by this section, where the user finds details about the distinct projects, as a place where the eye can rest and soak information. That way this website counts as a testemony that websites can be complex without having to sacrifise usefullness- and that not every site has to be a scrolling race to the bottom.</div>
